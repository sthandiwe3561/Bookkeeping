ðŸ§¾ Project Title:
A digital bookkeeping web app to help small businesses track services and generate downloadable invoices.

ðŸš€ Features:
1. Add services and customers
2. Generate and download PDF invoices
3. Filter/search for service history
4. Soft delete with confirmation prompt
5. Responsive UI

ðŸŽ¯ Why I Built This:
I built this app to support a real small business owner who was struggling with manual bookkeeping. Their record-keeping process was paper-based and time-consuming, making it difficult to track services or prepare accurate reports for their external accountant.

This app makes it easier for them to log, manage, and access service records â€” saving time and reducing errors. Over time, it can also help them lower the fees they pay to their accountant, as the system organizes and presents exactly whatâ€™s needed without extra effort.

Beyond solving a real-world problem, I used this project to challenge myself. I designed my own database models, implemented full CRUD functionality, and learned how to generate downloadable PDFs using xhtml2pdf.

The business is not tech-savvy, so I also wanted to show them how technology can simplify their operations and be something they can rely on, even with limited experience.
