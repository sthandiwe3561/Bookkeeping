ðŸ§¾ Project Title:
A digital bookkeeping web app to help small businesses track services and generate downloadable invoices.

ðŸš€ Features:
1. Add services and customers
2. Generate and download PDF invoices
3. Filter/search for service history
4. Soft delete with confirmation prompt
5. Responsive UI

ðŸŽ¯ Why I Built This:
I built this to help a real small business owner who struggled to track services manually. It also challenged me to design my own models, handle CRUD logic, and use tools like xhtml2pdf for the first time.
